### Hi there, I'm Wenlan (Tony) Xie 👋

I am a student at **The University of Chicago** 🇺🇸, with a background in Data Analytics and Economics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Behavioral Economics** and **AI in Finance** (e.g., NLP, Sentiment Analysis).

> 💡 **Note:** I use this GitHub profile primarily to share and maintain **replication codes** for my published papers to ensure research transparency and reproducibility.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Research Assistant at **UChicago Dept. of Economics**, focusing on partial identification strategies and RDD replication.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on topics related to **Financial Economics** and **Machine Learning applications in Social Sciences**.
